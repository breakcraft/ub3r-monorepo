### Issue Title

The issue title should be as descriptive as one sentence lets you be. Should preferably also follow [title casing rules](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case), _although that's more of a preference for the sake of consistency_.

### Issue Content

Some lists that define what we hope to see included in submitted issues. Not everything in these lists is necessary applicable for all issues, so add the things that are.
